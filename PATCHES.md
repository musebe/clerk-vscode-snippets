# Release-workflow-makefile

This file, named "release-workflow-makefile," serves as a robust automation tool tailored to optimize the release process for software projects. It orchestrates essential tasks crucial for a seamless release, encompassing commit operations adhering to meaningful conventions, automated testing to ensure code robustness, and streamlined patch application procedures. Through an interactive menu, developers can choose from a range of commit types, promoting standardized commit messages. Moreover, the Makefile prompts users to confirm the application of patches prior to pushing changes to the main branch on GitHub. With its comprehensive capabilities, this file empowers developers to concentrate on code quality and efficient project delivery.

1. **Major Version (X.Y.Z)**:
   - The major version number (X) represents significant and potentially breaking changes to the software.
   - It is incremented when there are major new features or changes that are not backward compatible with the previous version.
   - A major version increase often indicates that users may need to make adjustments to their code or workflows to accommodate the changes.
   - It can also indicate changes in the overall architecture or design of the software.

2. **Minor Version (X.Y.Z)**:
   - The minor version number (Y) signifies smaller, backward-compatible features and enhancements.
   - It is incremented when new functionality is added to the software without breaking existing features or causing compatibility issues.
   - Users can generally expect their existing code to work seamlessly with a new minor version.

3. **Patch Version (X.Y.Z)**:
   - The patch version number (Z) indicates bug fixes, small improvements, and other minor changes.
   - It is incremented for each release that includes fixes for issues found in the previous version.
   - Patch versions are typically used to address security vulnerabilities, correct errors, and improve stability.
   - These changes should have no impact on the software's existing features or behavior.

Here's an example to illustrate the difference:

Suppose the current version of a software project is 2.1.0.

- If the development team makes a significant change that requires users to update their code to accommodate the changes, they might release version 3.0.0 (major version increase).
- If the team adds new features that don't break existing functionality, they might release version 2.2.0 (minor version increase).
- If the team discovers and fixes some bugs in the software, they might release version 2.1.1 (patch version increase).
